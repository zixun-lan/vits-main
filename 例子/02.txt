Indeed, if we spend a lot of space describing second novelty, we should compare it with other PEs, although there is no PE like our proposed PE before. So, we need to focus the paper on MCS-RSC and re-organize the paper in the future. On the other hand, we should include some literature reviews on MCS, graph matching and subgraph matching methods in the Section. related work. Regarding the fairness of the previous approach, we performed a hyperparameter search on the validation set for all other previous baseline models, which made the results of the previous method better and fairer.
